## NearMe

An AngularJS app to help find places of interest (as determined by having a wikipedia entry) in your vicinity.

The project uses the third-party leaflet directive for maps, and the Wikipedia geodata api to find places of interst.

Project began with a codecademy tutorial, to which I added
* auto-center on your location (if you give your browser permission)
* auto-search whenever map is moved
* an enhanced welcome page
